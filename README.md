## Downloading the source code
Since this software uses a library as a git submodule, it can not simply be 
downloaded from github. The correct procedure is:

```bash
git clone $this_repo_url
cd $this_repo_name
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Usage

1. You must download the information of the best people that you know (acquisition)
2. Then they must be processed to generate a model (processing)
3. At this point you can download the profiles of some unknown people (acquisition)
4. ... and weighed against the previously created model (analysis)
